# Python_Project_on_Contact_Book_Managemen
📘 Contact Book Management System
An interactive and efficient Command-Line Interface (CLI) application developed using Python to manage employee contact records with ease.
This system supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provides a seamless way to store, modify, and retrieve contact information—making it a foundational tool for understanding structured data handling and user interaction in CLI environments.

🔍 Description
A user-friendly CLI-based contact management system designed to handle employee data such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and job titles. The system enables users to:

• ➕ Add new employee contacts

• 🗂️ Display all stored contacts

• 🔍 Search for a specific contact

• 🖊️ Modify contact details

• ❌ Delete unwanted entries

The application demonstrates effective use of data structures, conditional logic, and modular programming to deliver a clean and maintainable codebase.

🧾 Key Functionalities
• 📥 Add Contact – Store new contact details in a structured format

• 📤 View Contacts – List all existing contact records with clear formatting

• ✏️ Edit Contact – Update contact details like phone, email, or name
